Social Media Platform

Goal:
In the era of digitalization, social media platforms have become a significant part of people's lives.
Your task is to create a rudimentary version of a social media platform where users can connect with friends,
family, and acquaintances from around the globe. The users should be able to share their life moments through posts, 
express their reactions to other users' posts, and engage in discussions through comments. 
Think about the kind of functionalities that would foster positive and vibrant social interactions â€” 
perhaps a feature that allows sharing interesting posts or a notification system that keeps users updated on the 
latest comments and likes. Your goal is to craft a platform that encourages socialization and helps users stay connected with their loved ones.
