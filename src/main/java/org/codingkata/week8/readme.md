1. An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer n, return
true if n is an ugly number.

Create a class named Pizza that stores information about a single pizza. It should contain the following:

2. Private instance variables to store the size of the pizza  (either small, medium,or large), the number of cheese
toppings, the number of pepperoni toppings, and the number of ham toppings.
Constructor(s) that set all of the instance variables.
Public methods to get and set the instance variables.
A public method named calcCost( ) that returns a double that is the cost of the pizza.Pizza cost is determined by:

Small: $10 + $2 per topping
Medium: $12 + $2 per topping
Large: $14 + $2 per topping

public method named getDescription()that returns a String containing the pizzasize, quantity of each topping.

Write test code to create several pizzas and
output their descriptions. For example, a large pizza with one cheese, one pepperoni and two ham toppings should cost
a
total of$22. Now Create a PizzaOrder class that allows up to three pizzas to be saved in an order.Each pizza saved
should be a Pizza object. Create a method calcTotal() that returns the cost of order. In the runner order two pizzas
and
return the total cost.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
